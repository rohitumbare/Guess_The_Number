I am thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project - Guess the Number! 🌟

🎯 Project Details: <br>
I created a fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer

💡 Key Features:<br>
✅ The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100. <br>
✅ The user is prompted to enter their given number.<br>
✅ The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher or lower than the generated number.<br>
✅ The game continues under the user guessing the number.<br>
✅ Limiting the number of attempts.<br>
✅ Giving points based on the number of attempts.<br>
✅ Displaying performance.<br>

🛠 Technologies Used:<br>

🎓 Learning Experience:<br>
Building this project taught me a lot about Core-Java development. I faced challenges and grew as a developer with each step.

📢 I'd love to hear your thoughts!

🔍 Looking forward to your feedback and support as I continue my journey in the world of development.
